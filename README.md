# How To Run

You should use GPU taht is called CUDA (version is anything ok).



## 1. You need take in a lot of pictures to dir '/pictures/'
and then, you may have the pictures that include punctuation '.HEIC' or '.heic', so you have to change your pictures punctuations.

So, Run the code.
```zsh:change_extension.py
python3 change_extension.py
```
In this file, your all pictures puctuations in '/pictures/' will be changed '.JPG'.

python cannot read the extension '.HEIC' or '.heic'.
